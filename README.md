# Portfolio-for-Application
This is a portfolio for my application to University of Edinburgh

Project HARI
===============
The first folder is the year-2 group work for my HCI unit in Computer Science BSc in University of Bristol. 
---------------
  This unit asked us as a group to design a prototype of a smart kitchen appliance. Our design followed the idea of user centred design, created personas, and identyfied the user's need by conducting interviews. Our final work is a smart device, named HARI, that will smartly control the user's hob and providing recipes while the user is cooking. HARI will reduce the risk of causing the fire alerm and offer guidance on cooking. 
  
  Each member in the group eaqually contribute to the design, the final work came from the study and discussion among all members. I was responsible to the final presentation part.
  
  Through this project and the learning in this unit, I have gain vast experience on design approach, communicating to the user group, and teamwork experience.
  
  The folder includes the presentation PPT and PPT-version report.
  
  
Project Olympiods
  =============
The second folder is the year-2 individual mini-project of my CGI unit in Computer Science BSc in University of Bristol. 
  ---------------
   This unit has given an imaginary background that in the near future the android instead of human will take part in the Olympic Games, and asking the students to design a robot character to compete in one event. The student need to used the learnt knowledge from this unit to model the robot in Maya, a 3-D modelling application, rig the skeleton of the robot, map texture, and finally animate the model to create a 10-second video clip to show this character competing in the event. The project is individual and all work in this project is credit to me. 
   
   This unit gave me the first taste on playing with the technique that are currently used in flim and game industry. This project brought me experience on 3-D modelling and designing a vitual character. Although the background is given by the lecturer, I had opportunities to put my creativity in the process of design the appearance and the movement of the character. Besides, I had gain considerable confidence and sense of achievement by overcoming the challenges I met in the process of developing the model and animation, so I really enjoyed the learning process of this unit.
   
   The folder includes the output video, Maya binary file and the process report.
   
 
 Project Serious Game
 ==========
 The third folder is the individual project for my Computer Science BSc degree in University of Bristol. 
 ---------
   Starting with a motivation came from a HCI peer tutorial, I decide to develop a serious game that could educate junior high school student money management skills. I had done a number of research on the topic of serious games, game designing, education, finance and psychology to support the dfevelopment of the game.
