# Portfolio-for-Application
This is a portfolio for my application to University of Edinburgh


The first folder is the group work for my HCI unit in Computer Science BSc in University of Bristol. 
  This unit asked us as a group to design a prototype of a smart kitchen appliance. Our design followed the idea of user centred design, created personas, and identyfied the user's need by conducting interviews. Our final work is a smart device, named HARI, that will smartly control the user's hob and providing recipes while the user is cooking. HARI will reduce the risk of causing the fire alerm and offer guidance on cooking.
